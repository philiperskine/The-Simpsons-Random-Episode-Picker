This is a fun Python project I made to randomly select classic episodes of the TV show 'The Simpsons'!

You can either pick a random episode from any of the first 8 seasons I have included, or pick a random episode from a particular season. The code can be easily expanded to include later seasons if you like, I just happen to like this era of the show the most!

A couple of extra useful features include the Disney+ episode numbering system and availability (for example, it will flag that you cannot watch the original first episode of Season 3 'Stark Raving Dad' on Disney+, and it tells you that Disney+ lists 'Mr Lisa Goes To Washington' as "Season 3: Episode 1") as well as DVD disc numbers if you want to watch the old-school way!

I have made the menu super user-friendly to allow multiple picks before quitting, and have even added a short delay before announcing each random episode just for suspense.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
